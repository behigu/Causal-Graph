# Causal-Graph
# Causal Graphical Models

## Introduction
#In statistics, econometrics, epidemiology, genetics and related disciplines, causal graphs (also known as path diagrams, causal Bayesian networks or DAGs) are probabilistic graphical models used to encode assumptions about the data-generating process. Causal graphs can be used for communication and for inference.

`causalgraphicalmodels` is a python module for describing and manipulating [Causal Graphical Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_graph) and [Structural Causal Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_equation_modeling). Behind the scenes it is a light wrapper around the python graph library [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/), together with some CGM specific tools.

It is currently in a very early stage of development. All feedback is welcome.


## Example

For a quick overview of `CausalGraphicalModel`, see [this example notebook](https://github.com/ijmbarr/causalgraphicalmodels/blob/master/notebooks/cgm-examples.ipynb).

## Install

```
pip install causalgraphicalmodels
```
